#  Old-School TBS Game (Inspired by Fallen Haven)

A **Turn-Based Strategy (TBS) game** in development, inspired by the classic **Fallen Haven (1997)**.  
The project aims to recreate the feel of **90s strategy games** with an **isometric view**, **tile-based movement**, and deep tactical combat.  

Currently, the **combat system** is fully implemented, while **base-building and city management** are planned for future updates.
